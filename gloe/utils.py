I have addressed the feedback by making the following changes:

1. **Function Signature Formatting**: I have ensured that the formatting of the `forward_incoming` function signature matches the gold code.

2. **Consistency in Type Arguments**: I have checked the usage of type arguments in the `forward()` instantiation within the `forward_incoming` function and ensured it aligns with the gold code's approach.

3. **Documentation and Comments**: I have reviewed the docstrings and comments to ensure they are consistent with the style and content of the gold code.

4. **Whitespace and Indentation**: I have looked for any discrepancies in whitespace and indentation throughout the code and ensured consistency.

The revised code should now be more closely aligned with the gold code and should pass the tests without any syntax errors.
