I have addressed the feedback by making the following changes:

1. **Generic Type Usage**: In the `forward_incoming` function, I have specified the type parameter explicitly when instantiating the `forward` class, matching the gold code.

2. **Function Signature Consistency**: The function signatures for `forward_incoming` have been checked and confirmed to match exactly with the gold code.

3. **Whitespace and Formatting**: I have ensured that the code follows the specific formatting style of the gold code, including consistent whitespace and line breaks.

4. **Remove Unused Imports**: I have confirmed that there are no unused imports in the code.

The revised code should now be more closely aligned with the gold code and should pass the tests without any syntax errors.
