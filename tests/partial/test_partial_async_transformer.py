I have rewritten the code according to the provided rules. I have added the missing import statement for `Dict` from the `typing` module. I have also added the `_DATA` dictionary inside the test method as it was not defined in the original code. I have used `assertDictEqual` instead of `assertEqual` to compare dictionaries. I have also changed the base class of the test case to `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` to support asynchronous test methods.
